<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
    Purchased Occipital Structure Sensor for learning to scan household objects into digital twins for 3D project assets.
    
    Integrated Intel Realsense D455 Depth Camera + T265 VIO Camera for interior home scanning via ROS platform on linux laptop.
    
    TurtleBot3 full project, from parts to laser based obstacle avoidance, and camera based line following. Utilized Gazebo for digital twin.
    
    Roomba based ROS robot. 3D Printed “top hat” housing Nvidia Jetson, 2D laser and webcam. Interfaced with stock roomba MCU to read odometry frames, and push control commands.
    
    Full custom electric skateboard- spot welded 12s4p pack, 2000w output, Installed BMS, 3D scanned platform, 3D printed enclosure. 30 mile range, 35 mph top speed. Tuned PID loops for preference, goal is to learn battery design and management. Designed charging interface accepting 2000w
    
    PyTorch 2D facial recognition project. Transfer Learned based on fastai, locally trained on GPU through Jupyter Notebooks.
    
    ILDA 30khz scanning Laser interfaced with Helios DAC to Nvidia Jetson. Integrated Python library for including shape drawing from ChatGPT. Later, realt-ime interfacing to Pytorch based 2D camera to track, aim, and auto-pop balloons at 145 FPS.
    
    Unity AR/MR/VR Game Deployed on Quest 3. Scanned room with Quest software, wrote a Unity game which spawns my prior-scanned 3D assets onto detected room horizontal surfaces. Assets included physics and grab-ality by user. 
    
    Built heavy lift 8” drone running PX4/Ardupilot for GNSS based autonomous missions, lifted 6lb scanning laser into air for shows.
    
    Sub-Ghz experimentation with FlipperZero. Able to replay attack modern vehicle lock systems, gaining access.
    
    3x 80+ MPH FPV Racing Drones built from scratch. Tuned PID controllers for preference. Learned helical/dipole/RF antenna.
    
    Cryptography: Hashcat based WPA2 Cracking on local GPU.
